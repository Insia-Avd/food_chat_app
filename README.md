## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install requirements:

sh
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Environment Variables
For security:
Your sensitive keys should NOT be stored in the repo.
This project uses a .env file for secrets.

The repo contains a .env.example file with variable names.

Do not use your real API key in .env.example!

Steps:

Make a copy of .env.example and rename it to .env:

bash
Copy
Edit
cp .env.example .env
Open .env and add your actual Google API key:

ini
Copy
Edit
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_real_api_key_here
4. Add Your Dataset
Place your food_data.csv in the project folder.

Ensure the column headers match those expected in the code.

5. Run the App
sh
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
🔐 Security
.env is listed in .gitignore and should never be pushed to GitHub.

Only .env.example is in the repo to show required variables (no secrets).

Never share your real API keys publicly.

👩‍💻 For Deployment
Make sure your host/server also sets up the .env file with secrets.

Never commit .env with real keys to version control.
